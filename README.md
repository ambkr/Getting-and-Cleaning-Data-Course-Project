Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the readme file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The "run_analysis.R" script performs a number of functions, including:

- downloading the data
- combining train data and test data
- subsets for select features - only those which are means and sds
- adds descriptive variable names to columns and descriptive categorical variable names for activity and features
- creates a second, independent tidy data set (newest_indie_data.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Thank you.
