Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the readme file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The "run_analysis.R" script performs a number of functions, including:

- downloading the data
- combining test data and train data
- find the means and sd for all subjects and activities
- adds descriptive variable names to columns and descriptive categorical variable names for "assigned cohort" and "activity"
- creates a second, independent tidy data set (tidy_indie_data) and TXT file (tidy_indie_data.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Thank you.
